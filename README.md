4 main financial statements 
1. balance sheets- shows what a company owns and owes at a fixed point in time
2. income statements - how much money a company made and spent over a period of time
3. cash flow statements - exchange of money betweeen a company and the outside wold over a period of time
4. statements of shareholder equity - changes in the interests of the company's shareholders over time

BALANCE SHEETS
-provide detailed information about a companys asssets, liabilities, and shareholder equity

-assets - thisngs the company owns that have value...meaning these assets can either be sold or used by the company to make products/provide services
assets include physical property (trucks, equitment, inventory) or conceptual things like trademarks and patents
cash is an asset as are company investments

-liabilities - money that the company owes to others, inludes money borrowed from a banck, rent, money owed to suppliers, payroll owed to employees, texes etc.

-shareholders equity - money left if company sold all its assets and paid off all liabilities (this leftover money belongs to shareholders, or owners of the company)

summary 
ASSETS = LIABILITIES + SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY
**companys assets have to equal or "balance" the sum of its liabilities and shareholders equity

assets generally listed based on liquidity to cash

current assets - expected to be converted to cash within one year (ex. inventory)
noncurrent assets - not expected to be converted to cash 
fixed assets - used to operate the business but not available for sale (ex trucks, office furniture)


INCOME STATEMENTS (net earnings/losses)
shows how much revenue was earned over a time period and the costs and expenses associated with earning that revenue

EPS (earnings per share) calculation telling the amount of money shareholders would revieve if the company distributed all of the net earnings for the period



serious gamblers bet only when they have the best of it (odds in there favor) and pass when they have the worst of it

what does it mean to have odds in your favor? winning more on a result than the true odds warrant

As Vegas
World casino owner Bob Stupak has said, “Having one-thousandth
of one percent the worst of it, if he plays long enough, that
one-thousandth of one percent will bust the richest man in the
world.”

In the long run a poker player’s overall win is the sum of his
mathematical expectations in individual situations. The more plays
you make with a positive expectation, the bigger winner you stand
to be. The more plays you make with a negative expectation, the
bigger loser you stand to be. Therefore, you should almost always
try to make the play that will maximize your positive expectation

That leads us to the Fundamental Theorem of Poker:
Every time you play a hand differently from the way
you would have played it if you could see all your
opponents’ cards, they gain; and every time you play
your hand the same way you would have played it if
you could see all their cards, they lose. Conversely,
every time opponents play their hands differently
from the way they would have if they could see all
your cards, you gain; and every time they play their
hands the same way they would have played if they
could see all your cards, you lose.

ex)
The Fundamental Theorem of Poker states that what is
most profitable for you is for your opponent to make the incorrect
play based on complete information about both hands. Since your
opponent is getting 9-to-1 odds (his $10 call might win him $90)
and is only about a 5-to-1 underdog to make a flush, it is correct
for him to call because a call has positive expectation. Since it is
correct for him to call, following the Fu

According to the Fundamental Theorem of Poker, you play
winning poker by playing as closely as possible to the way you
would play if you could see all your opponents’ cards;; and you try
to make your opponents play as far away from this Utopian level
as possible

The first goal is accomplished mainly by reading
hands and players accurately, because the closer you can come to
figuring out someone else’s hand, the fewer Fundamental Theorem
mistakes you will make. The second goal is accomplished by
playing deceptively.

Let us summarize this discussion of games with large antes
before moving on to small-ante games.
1. As the ante increases, you loosen up your starting-hand
requirements. There are four reasons for you to loosen up.
First, you are getting better pot odds. Second, it costs too
much money in antes to wait for big hands. Third, your
opponents are playing weaker hands. And finally, when you
play too tight against observant opponents, they will give you
no action when you do get a big hand.
2. As the ante increases, you loosen up on later rounds, too,
because the initial weaker requirements carry over into later
rounds. However, in multi-way pots, hands like mediocre
pairs decrease in value while drawing hands increase in value.
3. As the ante increases, you try to steal antes, especially against
tight players, because the play has good positive expectation.
4. As the ante increases, you raise with a good hand rather than
try to slowplay it because a large ante makes it likely your
opponents are getting their proper odds when you do not raise
and let them in cheaply. Furthermore, when the ante is large,
opponents may even call your raise when they are not getting
proper odds, which, according to the Fundamental Theorem,
is exactly what you want. They are even more likely to call
your raise if they suspect you have been stealing antes with
your raises on previous hands. 

The concepts discussed in this chapter may be summed up in
a few sentences. All poker begins as a struggle for the antes. The
size of the ante determines the way you play to a large extent,
because if you don’t struggle properly for the antes, you cost
yourself money one way or the other — either by playing too
many hands when there’s a small ante or too few when there’s a
large ante. With a low ante you should play tight (except in the
cases noted above), and as the ante increases, you should loosen
up.
